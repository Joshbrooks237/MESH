                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) is a powerful, full-spectrum cannabis extract created by Canadian engineer Rick Simpson. After discovering its healing potential when treating his own skin cancer, Rick developed a method to extract the beneficial compounds from cannabis plants.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <p>Unlike many modern cannabis products, RSO contains the full range of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other beneficial compounds found in the cannabis plant. This "entourage effect" is what makes RSO so effective for many people.<sup>2</sup></p>
